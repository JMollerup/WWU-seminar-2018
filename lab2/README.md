# Lab 2: Algorithm 1: Do something!

Today we are thinking about algorithms, which is just a fancy word for "code that does a useful thing". This encompasses both the technical or mathematical challenge of solving problems, and the functional need for writing *well documented* code that works as expected.


## Part 1: Update your Fork

Recall: last week you "Forked" the master version of the Seminar repository on GitHub (then did the assignment and submitted a Pull Request). Now I've updated the project, and it's time for you to [sync the latest revisions into your Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/).

So, add the upstream master to your local clone, and pull latest version locally. Your GitHub version will be synced too!

(By the way: a brute force way to do this is to delete your fork and your local clone, and re-fork it and clone it from scratch. This is a good workaround when things get very messed up...)

## Part 2: A basic "function"
One goal of writing useful computer code is to never repeat yourself, if possible. You achieve this by taking individual, repeatable tasks, and wrapping them up as "functions" (or classes, or methods, or what have you).
